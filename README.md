# Bidding System
 It is a system designed for businesses that utilize the idea of bidding so that we can keep track of every bid that has been made regardless of its source, which can be either an organization or an individual. Basically, it functions by waiting for the user to make an interrupt so that we give the user the priority, then we prompt him/her to enter the amount of money to bid.
